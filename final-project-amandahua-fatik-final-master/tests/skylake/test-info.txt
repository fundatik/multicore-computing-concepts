# PROCESS AFFINITY
test1 -> 	taskset cpu_affinity=compact 
test2 -> 	perf stat, number of migrations are higher for openmp version, 
		esp. 14,16,18,20 threads, needs to pin each thread to a specific cpu core
test3 ->	likwid-pin, assigning each thread to a physical core
test4 ->	perf stat after we prevent threads from migrating between cores 

# NUMA = spread or scatter
test5a -> 	likwid marker L3 MPKI, it needs to use make.def.likwid and mg.cpp.likwid
tets5b -> 	likwid marker memory bandwidth, it needs to use make.def.likwid and mg.cpp.likwid

test6  ->	evenly spread threads across all sockets and cores if the number of threads
		is higher than the number of cores in a socket
test7  ->	likwid marker mem,l3cache

# MEMORY POLICY
test8  ->	use numactl --interleave=all
test9  ->	likwid marker mem, l3cache

testX  ->	likwid marker remote hit, local hit

# LOOP SCHEDULING
test10 ->	dynamic scheduling, default chunk size
test11  ->	likwid marker, mem, l3cache
testY  ->	chunksize 8,16,64
